C++ was designed with an orientation toward systems programming and embedded,
resource-constrained software and large systems, with performance,
efficiency,
and flexibility of use as its design highlights.
C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications,
[11] including desktop applications,
video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or databases),
and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).
